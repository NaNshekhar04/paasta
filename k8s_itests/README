Kubernetes itest is done in a few steps.
Before test:
    Kind is required. It is intalled in before_script section in travis but its existence is assumed in devboxes.
    https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/
During test:
    1. Tests are triggered by `make k8s_itests` command in root folder.
    2. All environment variables are set in the Makefile and are exported. They are exposed to tox as well.
    3. All leftover from old tests are removed. A Kind cluster is then created.
    4. Tox runs
    5. Files in deployments/paasta folder are copied, dynamically rendered, and pasted to .tmp deployments/.tmp folder.
    6. PyTests run.
    7. Before real tests run, paasta soa configurations are set up and paasta api starts.
    8. Real tests run.
After test:
    PaaSTA api server stops. But kind cluster is not destroied and all the assets are not cleaned up. This is because creating
    kind is slow and it's a good idea to reuse it. You need to run `make clean`.
